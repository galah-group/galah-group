## What is Galah Interact?

The Galah Interact library, or Interact library, is a Python framework designed to make it very easy to create test harnesses that grade students' assignments. It provides functions to perform a number of tests that many instructors care about (such as checking that code is properly indented, or that code compiles without any warnings) along with providing utilities to make more complicated testing much easier (unit testing for example is extremely easy with this library, as you can simply import all of the student’s functions and classes into Python).

The reason for Galah Interact’s creation was to make it easier to create test harnesses for Galah, however, we don’t have any intention on locking in this library’s use (this is why we’ve released it under the very permissive Apache License v2). The real goal of Galah Interact is to provide a powerful framework for creating excellent test harnesses no matter what submission/testing system you are using for your class.
