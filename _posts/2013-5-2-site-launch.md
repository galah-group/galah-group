This site will serve as a portal, as a dev blog and announcment site, and as a source of information for anyone looking into using our products themselves.

I am launching the website before everything is ready so it can immediately start acting as a portal to the various pieces of documentation we have scattered around the web. Please don't be alarmed by the lack of content in the site itself, more will be added gradually over time.

Below is a rough timeline for what I plan to have us do to the site.

 1. Create mailing lists (probably on Google Groups) for each of the projects.
 1. Create a slideshow of screenshots on Galah's about page.
 1. Create an interactive version of the GG-GPL that lets users easily change the number of users allowed without a paid license.
