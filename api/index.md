## What is the API Client?

The API Client is a command line utility used to send commands to a running instance of Galah. Teachers and TA's use the API Client to manage their classes, assignments, and students enrolled in their classes. Administrators use it to create new classes, add new teachers, and perform other administrative tasks that do not require root access to the machine Galah is running on.

Currently the API Client is the only way to perform many teacherly activities in Galah, and though there are plans to add a web interface for teachers who are not comfortable on the command line, we believe that the API Client is much more pleasant that clicking through various menus to accomplish tasks that could be easily typed out.
