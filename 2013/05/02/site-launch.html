<p>This site will serve as a portal, as a dev blog and announcment site, and as a source of information for anyone looking into using our products themselves.</p>

<p>I am launching the website before everything is ready so it can immediately start acting as a portal to the various pieces of documentation we have scattered around the web. Please don&#8217;t be alarmed by the lack of content in the site itself, more will be added gradually over time.</p>

<p>Below is a rough timeline for what I plan to have us do to the site.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create mailing lists (probably on Google Groups) for each of the projects.</li>

<li>Create a slideshow of screenshots on Galah&#8217;s about page.</li>

<li>Create an interactive version of the GG-GPL that lets users easily change the number of users allowed without a paid license.</li>
</ol>
