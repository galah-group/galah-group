<p>We have created a live task list to show what each of us is doing and what our priorities are at any given time. Quick bug fixes and such will not make it onto these lists, but the large changes will. You can find the list <a href='https://github.com/galah-group/galah/wiki/Live-Task-List'>here</a>.</p>

<p>If this is useful we will continue to use it and I will put a permanent link on the site, but for now it&#8217;s just an experiment.</p>
