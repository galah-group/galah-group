# Galah Group General Public License

The Galah Group General Public License is a deriavitive of the [GNU AGPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) (which we created with permission from the [Free Software Foundation](http://fsf.org/)).

The GG-GPL preserves some of the ideals of [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) that it inherited from the AGPL and [Open Source](http://opensource.org/osd) but is **decidedly not a license of either**. I have given the term "commercial open source" to the license because that is the most concise few word description of it, but it is not truly an Open Source license, so please do not confuse it to be one.
